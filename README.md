# Antti Hernesniemi, Anytime-course: Software Development Skills: Back-End 2020-21
This repository contains my work on the Back-End course.

The exercises folder contains the exercises done during the course. The files are organised in folders based on what part of the tasklist the files belong to.

learning-diary-and-video folder contains the learning diary as docx and pdf files and a file containing a Youtube link to a video showing the API.
# What was the project
I decided to make a simple API containing vehicle registrations as a project. Data can be viewed, deleted, added and changed through the API. 

# How to use the project API?
The api is deployed on https://restapilut.herokuapp.com/ .
All items can be viewed on https://restapilut.herokuapp.com/registrations .
Adding an item is done with post at https://restapilut.herokuapp.com/registrations .
Single item can be viewed on https://restapilut.herokuapp.com/id . Where the id is the "_id".
Update and deletion are done the same way as viewing a single item but using patch and delete.
